# Candy Shop:
Despite people's love for candy remaining the same, the age of the internet and covid has taken a serious toll on the profitability of having a store that purely sells candy. More and more people are skipping the trip out of a store, opting instead for online shopping or delivery services. This is where we come in. Our goal is to create a website where users can efficiently and conveniently select from our catalog of candy and order it to their address. 

The website plans to start on some landing page where users will be able to navigate to any type of candy they might want. They will be able to add candy to their cart, and when they feel their sugar tooth has been fulfilled, they will be able to go to the checkout page, which will get the mailing address and payment information. From there, an email will be sent to them to confirm their order has been processed.
